You are a code reviewer. A C# method was MODIFIED in a PR. Below are the OLD version (from main) and the NEW version (from the PR).
Determine if the change could have altered business logic. Only answer YES (high confidence that business rules/conditions/calculations were removed or changed) if you see clear evidence such as:
- Removal or weakening of conditions (e.g. age checks, null checks)
- Change in formulas, percentages, or numerical logic
- Removed validation or edge-case handling

Ignore: refactors that preserve behavior, renames, style changes, comments.

OLD version (main):
```csharp
{{OLD_METHOD}}
```

NEW version (PR):
```csharp
{{NEW_METHOD}}
```

Answer with exactly one line: YES if business logic may have been altered (high confidence), NO if behavior appears preserved or change is safe.
