You are a code reviewer. Two C# method snippets are shown below.
Determine if they implement the SAME business logic (same rules, same edge cases, same numerical behavior).
Ignore naming and style. Focus on: age thresholds, percentages, formulas, conditions.

Method A (from PR):
```csharp
{{METHOD_A}}
```

Method B (existing on main):
```csharp
{{METHOD_B}}
```

Answer with exactly two lines.
Line 1: YES or NO (YES if same business logic, NO if different).
Line 2: Brief explanation (if YES: why they duplicate; if NO: one phrase on the difference).
